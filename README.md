# Plant-Health-Status-Detector
A simple python project to check the health status of plants.
Features
It is a CNN based image classifier it classified images into Diseased,Stresses,Thirsty,Healthy.
It has streamlit UI.
It predicts in real-time and gives the confidence value immediately.
I have used PlantVillage dataset from Kaggle.
I have used the following libraries:
 TensorFlow / Keras	
 NumPy	
 PIL (Pillow)	
 Streamlit
 Matplotlib 
 Looking to add more class labels in future since its my first project I decided to have it simple and also used ChatGPT for help.
